Introduction
 Purpose of the project
 The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator Website project aims to create a user-friendly and
 interactive tool that allows individuals to calculate their BMI based on height and weight. BMI
 is widely used to assess whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or
 obese. By providing users with instant feedback on their BMI category, this website helps
 promote awareness of personal health and encourages users to make informed lifestyle
 decisions.
 The project’s primary objective is to design and develop a functional website with an intuitive
 interface that performs BMI calculations efficiently. This involves ensuring that the tool is
 accessible to users of all technical backgrounds while maintaining accuracy in results.
 Technologies used
 To achieve this, the following technologies were used:
 ● HTML:Forstructuring the website and creating the input fields, buttons, and result
 sections.
● CSS:Toenhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the website, ensuring it
 works seamlessly on various devices.
 ● JavaScript: For implementing the core logic of BMI calculation and dynamically
 displaying results based on user input.
 ● GitandGithub: For version control and storing the project.
 This project also demonstrates the importance of integrating basic programming concepts
 and web development skills to solve real-world problems and build practical solutions.
 Methodology
 The development of the BMI Calculator Website followed a structured approach, ensuring a
 balance between functionality, user experience, and technical implementation. Below is a
 step-by-step outline of the methodology used to complete the project:
 1. Research and Planning
 ● Research:
 ○ Studied the BMI formula and its categories (e.g. underweight, normal weight,
 overweight, obese).
 ○ Explored design inspirations for simple and accessible BMI calculators.
 ● Planning:
 ○ Defined the core features:
 ■ Aslideshow to display some related pictures
 ○
 ○
 ○
 ■ Input fields for height and weight.
 ■ Abutton to calculate BMI.
 ■ Real-time display of BMI definition, formula, category, and some tips
 for maintaining a healthy BMI.
2. Development Process
 1. HTML(Structure):
 ○ Created a basic structure for the webpage using semantic HTML elements.
 ○ Added:
 ■ Slideshow
 ■ Input fields for height and weight.
 ■ A"Calculate BMI" button.
 ■ Asection to display the results dynamically.
 ■ Anaccordion for definition, formula, categories, and tips.
 2. CSS(Styling):
 ○ Designed a clean, user-friendly interface:
 ■ Styled input fields, buttons, and the results section for better
 readability.
 ■ Improved the display of the accordion and the slideshow.
 3. JavaScript (Logic and Interaction):
 ○ Wrotethe BMI calculation function:
 ■ Captured user inputs (height and weight).
 ■ Validated inputs to handle incorrect or missing values.
 ■ Calculated BMI using the formula and determined the corresponding
 category.
 ○ Addedinteractivity:
 ■ Linked the "Calculate BMI" button to trigger the calculation function.
 ■ Displayed results dynamically without reloading the page.
 3. Testing and Debugging
 ● Conducted thorough testing:
 ○ Functional Testing: Checked whether BMI calculations were accurate for
 various inputs.
 ○ Validation Testing: Tested input restrictions (e.g. negative values,
 non-numeric inputs).
 ○ Cross-Browser Testing: Ensured compatibility across major web browsers
 like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
 ● Debuggedissues with layout alignment and JavaScript functionality to ensure a
 smooth user experience.
 4. Tools and Resources Used
 ● Development Tools:
 ○ VSCode:Forwriting and managing the project code.
 ○ Browser Developer Tools: For real-time testing and debugging.
 ● Technologies:
 ○ HTML,CSS,andJavaScript for building the website.
 ● Version Control (if applicable):
 ○ GitandGitHub were used to manage code versions and collaborate.
This methodology ensured the project met its goals efficiently while maintaining a focus on
 usability and technical accuracy.
 Features
 ● User-friendly input fields.
 ● Real-time BMI calculation and categorization (underweight, normal, overweight,
 obese).
 ● Responsive design.

Testing
 Testing was a critical part of the project to ensure the functionality, accuracy, and usability of
 the BMI Calculator Website. The following types of tests were conducted:
 1. Functional Testing
 ● Verified that the calculator accurately computes BMI using the formula
 ● Ensured the correct BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese)
 was displayed for various inputs.
 2. Input Validation Testing
 ● Tested how the website handled invalid inputs, such as:
 ○ Non-numeric values (e.g., letters or special characters).
 ○ Negative numbers or zero for height and weight.
 ○ Extremely large or small values.
 3. Performance Testing
 ● Assessed the speed of BMI calculation and result display. The output was
 near-instantaneous, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Results
 The BMI Calculator Website was successfully developed and tested, achieving the following
 outcomes:
 1. Functionality
 ● Thewebsite calculates BMI accurately for all valid inputs and dynamically displays
 the result along with the BMI category.
 ● Proper error messages are shown for invalid or missing inputs, enhancing usability.
 2. User Experience
 ● Thedesign is simple and intuitive, making it accessible to users of all technical
 backgrounds.
 ● Responsive design ensures a seamless experience on various devices and screen
 sizes.
 4. Observations
 ● Strengths:
 ○ Accurate BMI calculations.
 ○ Real-time interactivity with JavaScript.
 ○ Cleanand responsive design.
 ● Areasfor Improvement:
 ○ Adding additional features like unit conversion (e.g., pounds to kilograms).
 ○ Implementing a feature to store or share results.
 These results demonstrate the project's success in meeting its objectives while highlighting
 opportunities for future enhancements.
